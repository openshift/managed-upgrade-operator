# managed-upgrade-operator Metrics (MUO)

The Managed Upgrade Operator reports the following metrics via direct instrumention:

## Metrics use to alert SRE

- `upgradeoperator_upgradeconfig_validation_failed`: If failed to validate the upgrade config `value > 0`
- `upgradeoperator_cluster_check_failed`: If failed on the cluster check step `value > 0`
- `upgradeoperator_scaling_failed`: If failed to scale up extra workers `value > 0`
- `upgradeoperator_controlplane_timeout`: If control plane upgrade timeout `value > 0`
- `upgradeoperator_worker_timeout`: If worker nodes upgrade timeout `value > 0`
- `upgradeoperator_node_drain_timeout`: If node cannot be drained successfully in time `value > 0`
- `upgradeoperator_upgradeconfig_sync_timestamp`: Set a timestamp as the value of the metric if the upgradeconfig sync succeeded

## Metrics for fleet-wide monitoring

The following metrics are forwarded to Observatorium-MST for fleetwide monitoring via grafana

- `upgradeoperator_upgrade_result`: Contains results from the previous upgrade. If upgrade fired a paging alert `value == 0` and the `alerts` field contains the name of alerts fired

## Metrics for upgrade conditions and state

There is now a Collector that creates metrics strictly based on the UpgradeConfig CR.
